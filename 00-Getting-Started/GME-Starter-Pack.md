Thirdly, here are some definitions of key financial terms in alphabetical order (these are copied and pasted from investopedia because I am not an expert myself!

## Financial Terms

**Call Options**: financial contracts that give the option buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock, bond, commodity or other asset or instrument at a specified price within a specific time period. A call buyer profits when the underlying asset increases in price.

**ETF**: An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trade on an exchange, just like a stock. ETF share prices fluctuate all day as the ETF is bought and sold

**FTD** (or Failure To Deliver): refers to a situation where one party in a trading contract (whether it's shares, futures, options, or forward contracts) does not deliver on their obligation. Such failures occur when a buyer (the party with a long position) does not have enough money to take delivery and pay for the transaction at settlement. A failure can also occur when the seller (the party with a short position) does not own all or any of the underlying assets required at settlement, and so cannot make the delivery.

**Gamma Squeeze**: a trading terminology that refers to massive call buying leading to higher stock prices, which leads to more call buying, a higher stock price and so on.

**Long** (or Long position): The term long position describes what an investor has purchased when they buy a security or derivative with the expectation that it will rise in value.

**Market Makers** (MM): Many market makers are often brokerage houses that provide trading services for investors in an effort to keep financial markets liquid. A market maker can also be an individual trader (known as a local), but due to the size of securities needed to facilitate the volume of purchases and sales, the vast majority of market makers work on behalf of large institutions.

**Naked Short**: the illegal practice of [short selling](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist.

**Naked Calls**: A naked call is an options strategy in which an investor [writes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writing-an-option.asp) (sells) [call options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) on the open market without owning the underlying security.

**Options**: Options are financial instruments that are derivatives based on the value of underlying securities such as stocks. An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sell—depending on the type of contract they hold—the underlying asset.

**Put Options**: A put option is a contract giving the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell–or sell short–a specified amount of an underlying security at a pre-determined price within a specified time frame. This pre-determined price that buyer of the put option can sell at is called the strike price.

**RSI**: The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset

**Short squeeze**: A short squeeze occurs when a stock or other asset jumps sharply higher, forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to forestall even greater losses. Their scramble to buy only adds to the upward pressure on the stock's price.

**Short** (or Short position): A short, or a short position, is created when a trader sells a security first with the intention of repurchasing it or covering it later at a lower price. A trader may decide to short a security when she believes that the price of that security is likely to decrease in the near future.

**Short Interest** (or SI): Short interest is the number of shares that have been [sold short](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) but have not yet been [covered](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortcovering.asp) or closed out. Short interest, which can be expressed as a number or percentage, is an indicator of market sentiment.
